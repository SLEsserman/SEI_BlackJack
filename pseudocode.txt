HTML:

A header section to display the game title and possibly a logo
A section to display the dealer's cards
A section to display the player's cards
A section to display the player's current score
A section to display buttons for actions like hit, stand, double, and deal
A section to display messages to the player like "You win!" or "Bust!"


CSS:

Styles for the header section and each of the card sections
Styles for the buttons and messages section
Styles for the card images themselves, which will need to be dynamically updated


JS:

create an array to hold the deck of cards, with each card represented as an object containing a value and a suit.
Create a function to shuffle the deck of cards randomly using a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
Write a function to deal cards to the player and the dealer. This function should draw two cards for each player, and display them on the screen.
Create a function to calculate the total value of a player's hand. This function should take into account the values of the cards, with face cards worth 10 and Aces worth 1 or 11.
Write a function to determine if the player or dealer has Blackjack, which is an Ace and a 10-valued card.
Create a function to allow the player to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep their current hand) based on user input.
Implement logic to handle the dealer's turn. The dealer must draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.
Write a function to determine the winner of the game. The winner is the player with the highest hand value without going over 21.
Display the game results on the screen, including the winner, the player and dealer's hands, and the total value of each hand.
